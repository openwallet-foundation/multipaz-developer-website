## **üïµÔ∏è Verifier**

Learn how to implement a Verifier app using the Multipaz SDK to request and validate verifiable credentials from users, enabling secure and privacy-preserving identity verification.

**Note:**
This section of the Get Started guide is a work in progress. The reference implementation can be found in the [Mutipaz Identity Reader](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/multipaz-identity-reader) sample app. A standalone module with a streamlined interface is coming soon. Until then, use the existing Mutipaz Identity Reader app as your guide.

The Verifier implementation consists of several key components:

- **[Import Issuer Certificate](/docs/getting-started/verifier/import-cert)** - How to Import an IACA Certificate to the Mutipaz Identity Reader app
- **[Issuer Trust](/docs/getting-started/verifier/issuer-trust)** - Issuer trust ensures that credentials presented by a holder app are authentic and issued by trusted authorities.
- **[Read QR Code](/docs/getting-started/verifier/read-qr)** - How to read a QR code

Additional sections will be added as we continue building out the documentation.
